<h1>TEA BAG</h1>
<aside>
<blockquote>A tea bag or teabag is a small, porous, sealed bag or packet, typically containing tea leaves or the leaves of other herbs,
<span class="special-word"> which is immersed in water to steep and make an infusion</span>. Originally used only for tea (Camellia sinensis),
 they are now made with other tisanes ("herbal teas") as well.</blockquote>

<p style="color:green;font-size:20px;">Tea bags are commonly made of filter paper or food-grade plastic, or occasionally of silk cotton or silk.
The tea bag performs the same function as a tea infuser. Tea bags can be used multiple times until there is no extraction left.
<br>Some tea bags have an attached piece of string with a paper label at the top that assists in removing the bag, while also displaying the brand or variety of tea. 
There are also special tea filters that can be used to pour loose tea into and brew it in a bag in a cup.</P>
